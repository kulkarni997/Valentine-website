            Some people don’t enter life loudly —  
            they just stay… and things start changing.

            I didn’t notice the moment,
            but you slowly became important.

            Since you came into my world,
            normal days feel lighter…
            and everything feels a little more alive.

            Sitting with you feels easy.
            Even silence feels complete.
            With you, the day feels lighter.

            Nothing big happens,
            still everything feels special.
            Care grows quietly —
            and you became my calm.

<h2>To my cute and strong Penguin🐧</h2>

<div class="penguin-card">

    <div class="penguin-text">

        <h3>About the way you is</h3>
        <p>
        You don’t act perfect — and that’s exactly what I like.
        You stay real, even on bad days.
        You talk openly, feel deeply, and still pretend you’re fine.
        </p>

        <h3>Your expressions</h3>
        <p>
        Your smile doesn’t try to impress — it just happens, and it stays with me.
        Even your serious face isn’t serious for long.
        </p>

        <h3>Your behaviour</h3>
        <p>
        You complain, you argue, you explain everything…
        and somehow it all still feels nice to listen to.
        You never try to be cute — but you end up being cute anyway.
        </p>

        <h3>Your comfort</h3>
        <p>
        You make space feel comfortable without doing anything big.
        With you, I don’t have to act different — I just stay myself.
        </p>

        <h3>Your little habits</h3>
        <p>
        You say you’re tired, but still stay longer.
        You act strong — but I notice the soft side you don’t show everyone.
        </p>

        <h3>Why you matter</h3>
        <p>
        You didn’t become important suddenly.
        It happened slowly — and then completely.
        I didn’t choose to like you… it just felt natural.
        </p>
